[![DNP3 Protocol Python](https://github.com/FreyrSCADA/DNP3/raw/master/img/dnp3-python.jpg)](http://www.freyrscada.com/dnp3-python.php)

we did a python wrapper for our DNP3 implementation using ctypes , and tested in Windows and linux x86_64.

in the package tests folder , you can find the server and client test programs.

using this, you can simulate complete dnp3 Server device(dnp3servertest.py) and client(dnp3clienttest.py).
