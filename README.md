# [DNP3 Protocol](https://www.freyrscada.com/dnp3-ieee-1815.php)

Distributed Network Protocol 3 ( DNP3 ) is a set of communications protocols used between components in process automation systems. Its main use is in utilities such as electric and water companies. 

Usage in other industries is not common. It was developed for communications between various types of data acquisition and control equipment. It plays a crucial role in SCADA systems, where it is used by SCADA Master Stations (a.k.a. Control Centers), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). It is primarily used for communications between a master station and RTUs or IEDs.
