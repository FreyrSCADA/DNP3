## Simulator License model:

### Annual subscription Based license:

An Annual License allows the customer to use the licensed software for one year, download updates and request technical support. At the end of the year the customer must renew their term license to continue using the software.
In this License model, FreyrSCADA deliver Simulator Installer for Windows Operating System.
The Customer can use the software company wide. Customer can install the software in many systems. There is no restriction like Hardware key (Dongle) and software key. 

### Unlimited year license:

A Perpetual License allows the customer to purchase a license to use the software forever. The Perpetual License also comes with an annual renewal fee that enables the customer to update the software to the latest version.
In this License model, FreyrSCADA deliver Simulator Installer for Windows Operating System.
The Customer can use the software company wide. Customer can install the software in many systems. There is no restriction like Hardware key (Dongle) and software key. 
For Unlimited year license, after a year, you will have the option to renew the Maintenance Plan to continue receiving technical support and upgrades.  The renewal price after a year is 10% of the product list price at the time of renewal (optional). Without renew the AMC also the software works. But for technical support and upgrades, the customer has an option for AMC.


# [DNP3 Protocol](https://www.freyrscada.com/dnp3-ieee-1815.php)

Distributed Network Protocol 3 ( DNP3 ) is a set of communications protocols used between components in process automation systems. Its main use is in utilities such as electric and water companies. 

Usage in other industries is not common. It was developed for communications between various types of data acquisition and control equipment. It plays a crucial role in SCADA systems, where it is used by SCADA Master Stations (a.k.a. Control Centers), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). It is primarily used for communications between a master station and RTUs or IEDs.

DNP3 Protocol - (Outstation) Server Simulator, Client (Master) Simulator, Windows and Linux (ARM) - C, C++, C# .NET Programming 

Complete implementation of DNP3 protocol standard including File transfer.

Binary Input, Double-bit Binary Input, Binary Output, Counter Input, Analog Input, Analog output, Octect String, virtual terminal String.

support CROB, analog output command with "select-before-operate" or "direct-execute" command execution modes, unsolicited response, Time Syncronization

Industry proven, tested with all leading test tools
